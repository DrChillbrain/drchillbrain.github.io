          <h3>4/11/2023</h3>
          <p>Started on the card frame.</p>
          <h3>4/3/2023-4/10/2023</h3>
          <p>
            I'm bundling all of these together since I basically just did the
            same stuff every single day. I talked to a bunch of people and did
            research on my own to get to a final set of 150 ingredient cards for
            the final game. This has taken most of the time for this project,
            but I'm very satisfied with the cards and jokes I was able to get in
            here, and the only thing I need to do now is turn these into actual
            card images and write the rulebook, neither of which should be too
            strenuous (though the cards will probably be pretty repetetive to
            make).
          </p>
          <h3>4/2/2023</h3>
          <p>Was busy today so couldn't work on stuff.</p>
          <h3>4/1/2023</h3>
          <p>Couple more cards.</p>
          <h3>3/31/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Worked on a different personal creative project today. Not actually
            related to this class but I feel like it was still productive.
          </p>
          <h3>3/30/2023</h3>
          <p>More cards.</p>
          <h3>3/29/2023</h3>
          <p>
            I feel like most of these are just gonna be "Made more cards" for
            awhile. The rules for the game are fairly simply, the bulk of the
            work is getting a large enough variety of cards.
          </p>
          <h3>3/28/2023</h3>
          <p>Wrote some more names.</p>
          <h3>3/27/2023</h3>
          <p>Spent today working on stuff for other classes.</p>
          <h3>3/19/2023-3/26/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Spring Break! Didn't have too much time to work on the game this
            week due to job stuff, taxes, and otherwise taking the week off, but
            I did write down some notes to come back to.
          </p>
          <h3>3/18/2023</h3>
          <p>Wittled away at the card list a bit.</p>
          <h3>3/17/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Wrote down some notes for some potential rules and started a list of
            cards.
          </p>
          <h3>3/16/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Had a long convo about the name of the game. Ended up settling on
            "Marmalada Gumbo" over Pizza, it has better mouthfeel and feels more
            like a cooking show thing rather than "lol random pizza"
          </p>
          <h3>3/15/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Worked more on that design doc and brainstormed some different
            drfaing mechanics.
          </p>
          <h3>3/14/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Started writing up the design doc for Marmalade Pizza (working title
            for the ingredient drafing game)
          </p>
          <h3>3/13/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Taking a small break between projects today for some Tamer
            Tournament playtesting! Went well and got a lot of great data that
            will inform the next version.
            <img src="img/playtest.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="50%" /><br />
          </p>
          <h3>3/12/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Burgermancers is complete! There's a lot I'd want to do if this
            would become a commercial product (and it's also largely
            unplaytested) but for what it is I think it's pretty cool and at the
            very least the start of something that could be really really fun.
          </p>
          <h3>3/11/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Last thing to do is make the rest of the cards. Today I finished all
            the Loot cards and started on the Monster cards.
          </p>
          <h3>3/10/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Rulebook is finished! If this was a published game there's obviously
            a lot I would change about it but as a minimum viable product, it
            works.
          </p>
          <h3>3/9/2023</h3>
          <p>Worked more on the rulebook.</p>
          <h3>3/8/2023</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Lots</b> of progress today! Remade the card frame in a Square
            format to fit on the board, finished the image for the board itself,
            and started on the rulebook. Should be set up perfect to finish a
            first draft by the end of the weekend!
            <br />

            <img src="img/board.png" class="img-fluid" width="50%" /><br />
          </p>
          <h3>3/7/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Started on a final version of the board. Did you know the first
            Google result for "11 by 11 grid" is a 10 by 10 grid? That definetly
            didn't cost me like 15 minutes of redrawing.
          </p>
          <h3>3/6/2023</h3>
          <p>
            A lot of the previous cards were made in a real hurry and were a bit
            uninspired. Went back and punched some of those up, as well as took
            suggestions from friends on some things like better names for
            enemies.
          </p>
          <h3>3/5/2023</h3>
          <p>
            After today RECON is finally over and I'll be able to work more on
            this stuff.
          </p>
          <h3>3/4/2023</h3>
          <p>
            From the time I woke up to the time I went to sleep today I was at
            RECON.
          </p>
          <h3>3/3/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Unfortunately for the second weekend in a row I'm gonna be really
            busy and not able to work much on stuff for this class. I'm one of
            the people in charge of RECON, a convention for the clubs at Miami,
            so I'm gonna spend the weekend on that, including today.
          </p>
          <h3>3/2/2023</h3>
          <p>Worked today on, you guessed it, more card effects.</p>
          <h3>3/1/2023</h3>
          <p>
            I've made a lot of good progress on card effects, which means it's
            time to start on grpahic design. Since this would theoretically be
            pitched as a Pizza Tower adaptation I wanted to lean into thay
            game's very unique art style, and it's very fun to go for.<br />
            <img src="img/shotgun.png" class="img-fluid" width="50%" /><br />
          </p>
          <h3>2/28/2023</h3>
          <p>This is gonna shock you, but I worked on more cards today! Wow!</p>
          <h3>2/27/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Made a chart for all the enemies and worked on a bunch of those. Did
            some research into the reception and cards in TBOI Four Souls, a
            pretty similar game to what this is going for.
          </p>
          <h3>2/26/2023</h3>
          <p>
            While I did spent today with my brother and then driving and
            unpacking and then at a club meeting, I did take some time to
            reflect on the games that I played with my brother over the weekend.
            We're both big tabletop fans and we played 3 different games over
            the weekend. The two that stood out the most were Star Realms and
            War of the Ring, which I had very different opinions on but both I
            think have important lessons to learn from. This is the research you
            need to do when working in this field and even if I didn't make any
            direct progress on Burgermancers I still think it wasn't an
            unproductive weekend.
          </p>
          <h3>2/25/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Spent all of today with my brother and the rest of my family. I
            think I needed the day off.
          </p>
          <h3>2/24/2023</h3>
          <p>Didn't get any ideas while driving. Whoops.</p>
          <h3>2/23/2023</h3>
          <p>
            I'm gonna be out of town all this weekend so I actually just spend
            today getting caught up on all my other stuff for other classes.
            Tomorrow I'll be commuting but I usually get good ideas while
            driving so we'll see if I can make any progress then.
          </p>
          <h3>2/22/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Drew up a more formal looking board on the Google Doc and rewrote
            some cards.
          </p>
          <h3>2/21/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Experimenting with a "Chest" mechanic to make positioning on the
            board matter: A space in the middle of the board with face-up
            powerful items you can exchange toppings for.
          </p>
          <h3>2/20/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Finished the characters and started writing out some item cards,
            including a specific item that's good for each specific character,
            encouraging players to attack each other and take the items that are
            better when playing as their characters.
          </p>
          <h3>2/19/2023</h3>
          <p>Wrote some enemies, items, and characters.</p>
          <h3>2/18/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Wrote 30 different names for different novelty burgers made of
            different ingredients. You make these on the grill to score points.
          </p>
          <h3>2/17/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Wrote out the basic structure and lues, plus some random ideas that
            were rattling around in my head.
          </p>
          <h3>2/16/2023</h3>
          <p>
            I think I'm at the point where I need to ask: Why am I even doing
            this? This isn't the structure I want this setting to take as a
            completed project, and it doesn't actually help me get more pieces
            completed for the sake of pitching to publishers. My time would be
            better spent working on literally anything else.<br />
            I still love this setting conceptually, and I really want to make
            something out of it, but at least for now I think I need to focus on
            a different project.<br />
            On that note, I started brainstorming and writing down notes for a
            new project today.
          </p>
          <h4>Burgermancers</h4>
          <p>
            Recently, I played two fantastic games: <i>Pizza Tower</i>, an
            action platformer by Tour De Pizza, and
            <i>Slay the Spire: The Board Game</i> by Contention Games.<br />
            Everything about <i>Pizza Tower</i> oozes love and creativity, from
            the 90s Nickelodeon cartton inspired artwork to the zany world and
            characters to the incredibly fast and fluid movement. The game sells
            its atmosphere of unbridled chaotic fun incredibly well, and it's
            hilariously ever-present Pizza theme constributes in a very fun way.
            I've been following the game's development since 2019 and after
            finally playing the full release, it's only left me wanting more.<br />
            <i>Slay the Spire</i> is another one of my favorite video games: The
            game largely responsible for the deckbuilder craze that's swept the
            indie space. The game is so replayable and mechanically tight and
            easy to pick up and play. But what I was pleasantly surprised by was
            how great its tabletop adaptation was. Contention Games managed to
            convert the gameplay of the video game into a new format, adding
            cooperative elements while maintaining the classic deckbuilding and
            upgrading, and removing or modifying mechanics to make things work
            in a tabletop space. It's very very well done, and it got me
            thinking a lot about adaptations.<br />
            How would I adapt the fast, fernetic gameplay and atmosphere of
            <i>Pizza Tower</i> into a tabletop game? Of course, I don't own the
            rights to Pizza Tower, so this would need to be its own thing. I'd
            love to actually pitch this as a Pizza Tower game to the devs to see
            if I could secure the license, once it's in a state where that's
            possible, but for the sake of this class I'm going to stick to it
            being its own IP. More progress to come.
          </p>
          <h3>2/15/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Alright, Page 2 is done now. I'll be honest while I have a bunch of
            ideas rattling around in my head for this project I really am not
            feeling actually writing them down. But I'll just keep working at it
            until things click.
          </p>
          <h3>2/14/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Got more into the rhythm of how SR66 is gonna work: Google Earth can
            provide most of the important phorography used for visuals, and
            writing will be as part of panels to the side of each photograph.
            Worked on the first page in this structure today.
          </p>
          <h3>2/13/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Alright, gotta get right into the next project. I did do a little
            bit of planning and sketching out of the SR66 pamphlet, but I did
            spend most of today working on a different personal project.
            Tomorrow I'll work more on it.

          <p>
            <b>We did it!</b><br />
            Finished up all the last cards, Sadie finished up all the art, and I
            also spent a bunch of time making the box and a bunch of assets for
            the website. Also ordered a copy of the game for my own: It'll be a
            bit before it gets here and I can actually sell the game to people,
            but it's done and I'm so excited about that.<br />

          <h3>2/11/2023</h3>
          <p>
            I had free time all day today so I was really excited to finish up
            the project. Unfortunately, my Adobe rental decided today would be a
            great day to end, and I won't be able to take out another rental
            until tomorrow. Which means I can't actually do the last card
            renders until then, or even add or fix things in the rulebook.
            That's really infuriating, honestly. I did still make progress
            today, getting everything I could uploaded to the Game Crafter
            website, but tomorrow is gonna be a whole lot busier now.
          </p>
          <h3>2/10/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Chipped away at a bunch more final card renders, over halfway done
            with those. The end is in sight!
          </p>
          <h3>2/9/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Finished the rulebook today! That's about the only thing to report
            but that's a big milestone.
          </p>
          <h3>2/8/2023</h3>
          <p>
            The deadline for this project is fast approaching, but progress is
            coming along very very well! Made a lot of progress on final card
            renders (got 12 done) as well as about one-third done with the
            rulebook.
          </p>
          <h3>2/7/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Worked more on the card frame: The Elements (Air, Water, Fire,
            Earth) each have a color and the Types (Spirit, Familiar, Monster)
            all have background texture so you can at a glance tell what each
            card is.<br />
            <img src="img/drimp.png" class="img-fluid" width="50%" /><br />
            Also touched base with Sadie: Not all of the card are gonna have
            nice finished art like Baby Drachna does, but they will all have at
            least sketches, which is good enough for an initial version I think.
          </p>
          <h3>2/6/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Touched up some on the mechanical side and set the card quantities.
            Most importantly though, we now have a card frame! Not the most
            professional looking work in the world, but it's visually appealing
            I think, especially enough for a prototype.<br />
            <img
              src="img/lildrachnaguy.png"
              class="img-fluid"
              width="50%"
            /><br />
            (Don't mind the really thick border, that's for making the printing
            service work right. Gotta give it some wiggle room.)
          </p>
          <h3>2/5/2023</h3>
          <p>
            The good news: I got a lot of great playtesting in today! (By
            myself, since I'm still a little sick.)<br />
            The bad news: There's a lot more changes I'll need to make to this
            game than I thought.<br />
            The foundational mechanics are still good and the changes since the
            last version have all been positive, but there's a ways to go yet.
            Specifically, the downsizing I did to the card pool was too much:
            The 5 card packs had so little freedom that the players weren't able
            to get really solid decks together. I think I've also identified
            that the during draft effects, while cute, are just too much of a
            pain to keep track of to be worth it.<br />
            I think the best way to increase the cardpool without making Sadie
            need to draw a bunch more art is to add extra copies of specifically
            the non-specific cards to the pool. I won't have time to make a new
            prototype, but I think I have decent enough idea of the balance
            changes I want to make that that will be fine.
          </p>
          <h3>2/4/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Had nothing to do today so was really excited to get a lot done on
            Tame Tournament and some other assignments. Unfortunately I woke up
            sick as a dog and had very little energy to do anything. I still got
            some assignments done but overall spent the day lying in bed and
            churning through an entire box of tissues. Tomorrow hopefully I'm
            feeling more up to testing.
          </p>
          <h3>2/3/2023</h3>
          <p>
            As I mentioned yesterday, today I had a job interview and plans with
            friends, so I was booked. The interview went great though!
          </p>
          <h3>2/2/2023</h3>
          <p>
            2 and a half hours later, the prototype is back in business! I'll
            probably be busy tomorrow with my job interview and other plans, but
            I'll try to get another playtest in ASAP.<br />
            <img src="img/prototype2.png" class="img-fluid" width="70%" />
          </p>
          <h3>2/1/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Spent today creating the renders for the great big redesigned cards.
            Gonna spend tomorrow making a physical prototype for this new
            version, then going to hop straight into playtesting it as soon as
            possible.
          </p>
          <h3>1/31/2023</h3>
          <p>
            The great big redesign is completed! Spent a bunch of time yesterday
            finishing that up. Tomorrow I'm gonna start translating this over to
            the physical prototype.
          </p>
          <h3>1/30/2023</h3>
          <p>
            The great big redesign begins! Basically all the cards are getting
            reworked based on the data from the last playtest. Spent about 3
            hours total working on it today, and it's just about done. The
            downsizing is gonna be good for getting the art done, too.
          </p>
          <h3>1/29/2023</h3>
          <p>
            First big playtest was today! A whole lot of things went horribly
            wrong but that's okay. Here's what we learned.<br />
            • There's too many buffs and the buffs are too high. Players had
            70/70 creatures by Round 3. That should not be able to happen.<br />
            • 8 cards per pck and 8 points per round are both too much.<br />
            • Having both temporary and permanent buffs was a bit confusing, and
            permament buffs contributed towards the crazy endgame numbers.<br />
            • Certain effects were really annoying to try to resolve, with
            regards to math and decision complexity.<br />
            I've got some ideas for that to change to fix these things, but
            they're going to require some fairly drastic retooling of the cards,
            so it'll take a few days I suspect.
          </p>
          <h3>1/28/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Redid the names and art descriptions for a whole bunch of the cards.
            The current ones, a lot of them were either total placeholders or
            didn't really match up with their assigned types very well (Young
            Drachna was a Fire Familiar, but Middle Aged Drachna was an Air
            Monster!). Now, not only do they make a lot more sense and avoid
            overlap with the same kind of creature on more than one card,
            there's also a whole lot better pun names. These changes were also
            made to the physical cards. Planning on doing some playtesting
            tomorrow.
          </p>
          <h3>1/27/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Spent today working on the "Introduce Yourself" video and things for
            other classes so didn't have much time to work on personal projects.
            Was still on the whole a productive day, though.
          </p>
          <h3>1/26/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Went through all the cards from the prototype I have printed out and
            added the new card numbers to them. This will make it easier to make
            changes during playtesting and keep track of things, but there were
            also 192 cards so it took awhile.
          </p>
          <h3>1/25/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Lots of progress today on Tamer Tournament. Sadie and I finalized
            our plan for how the collaboration is going to work, and I made a
            great big planning document for all the cards so we can track
            progress on rebalances and artwork. That took most of the day.
            <br />
            I've also encountered a potential conceptual problem with State
            Route 66's in-world world guide. Several important details about the
            way the world works are totally unknown to its residents. There's
            not a perfect way to address this while still keeping the in-world
            component intact, though I have had a couple ideas. Specifically,
            maybe having stuff written in the margins by the theoretical
            protagonist of the game, who learns these things over the course of
            their adventure. These being handwritten in pen in the blank spaces
            of an otherwise printed-appearing document should hopefully make
            that clear enough.
          </p>
          <h3>1/24/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Spent today researching some possibilities for what to do with State
            Route 66. On itch.io I was able to find a lot of really cool setting
            guides for TTRPGs: Many of them were tailored to one specific game
            system but many were also not. One specific one that I found
            interesting, though, was "Endsville."<br />
            <a href="https://johnbattle.itch.io/endsville"
              >Link to Endsville on itch.io</a
            ><br />
            Endsville is a setting guide, but written in-universe. This is a
            really compelling idea for me: Not only does it mean I don't have to
            tie this to a specific game system (that would break up the flow a
            lot, imo) it also has lots of its own opportunities for that good
            Midwestern flair, like one of those travel guides you get at an
            interstate rest stop. <br />
            There were some other ideas I explored, such as the game "Roll
            Player" which is essentially competetive character creation: Pretty
            cool, but I think an execution of that idea for this setting would
            more likely want to be cooperative, and I'm not quite as enthused
            about this idea.<br />
            The idea of a diagetic world guide, though, is one I'm really fired
            up about, and I think that's what I'm going to do with SR66 in this
            class.<br />
            In blog news, today was <i>actually</i> my birthday. So that's nice.
          </p>
          <h3>1/23/2023</h3>
          <p>
            Wow, first blog post! Here's where I'll be posting progress on my
            independent projects: I'll try to post something every day. I won't
            necessarily have something to show for my work every day, but at the
            very least I'll have chipped away at something.
            <br />
            On a thematic level it might have been better to wait to start this
            until tomorrow, since that will be the first day of my 20s.
            "Beginning of a new era" and all that. But ideas wait for no one so
            this is what you're stuck with.
            <br />
            Today I wanted to try and get at least a rough idea of the projects
            I was going to spend the next semester working on. All three of
            these are for a class intended to help with building a portfolio and
            the skills needed to make a living as a creative. Scoping out these
            things has proven difficult, though. I have a lot of ideas for
            things to make, but a lot of them are either a bit nebulous at the
            moment or are of far too grand a scope to be doable within one
            semester.
            <br />
          </p>
          <h4>State Route 66</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            This is the oldest of the projects I intend to do something with
            this semester, originating all the way back while I was in high
            school.<br />
            The biggest thing with this project is its setting, and that's
            basically the starting point for any project I end up making out of
            it. This idea was inspired by road-tripping around rural Ohio, and
            the unique atmosphere of long evening drives down sparsely populated
            state routes.<br />
            <img src="img/patricks.png" class="img-fluid" width="70%" /><br />
            This setting takes this idea and gives it a fantastical spin. There
            are two all-powerful beings in the world, a being of Creation and a
            being of Destruction. Every million years, the being of Destruction
            annihilates the world, before slumbering for another million years
            as the being of Creation remakes it anew. However, an excavation
            project accidentally awakens The Maelstrom early, and while it wipes
            out all of humankind, its work is left incomplete before it runs out
            of energy, so human civilization is left behind after its
            destruction.
            <br />
            The being of Creation, unprepared for this premature awakening, does
            their best to repopulate and remake the world as quickly as
            possible, shoving the still-present souls of eradicated humans into
            animals, objects, and whatever else it could find. These newly
            humanoid creatures repopulate this halfway-destroyed world, with
            lingering memories of language and purpose but a lack of context and
            history. However, hundreds of years later, the being of Creation
            senses that the being of Destruction will reawaken again far too
            soon, and so tasks a ragtag group of heroes with venturing to its
            resting place at the excavation site and putting a stop to this
            unnatural disruption of the cycle. So would begin a road trip across
            the country, meeting a wide cast of characters and overcoming
            various regoinal obstacles along the way.<br />
            The original idea for this project was something like a combat-light
            JRPG. Essentially, each fight in the game would be a unique
            character, almost like a bunch of minibosses, and winning each fight
            would give you access to that character's phone number, where in the
            future you could call them in battle where they'd use a special
            ability. This would essentially be your spells: Calling different
            phone numbers would use different amounts of your phone's battery,
            which would work like MP in other games. Each different assist would
            have a unique effect, and you only have limited memory on your phone
            to store the numbers you want to use, introducing a
            deckbuilding-like element of finding different synergies and
            strategies between all these unique skills. Thematically, this would
            emphasize the importance of each individual person you meet in your
            trip, and enshrining each memory as a permanent addition to your
            arsenal of tools really hammers home that aspect of what I love
            about traveling. In between these combat encounters would be a whole
            lot of dialogue, puzzle solving, and rural-inspired setpieces and
            enviornments.
            <br />
            This probably sounds like absolute nonsense: Once I get into working
            on this project I'm going to write up a better introduction to the
            setting, but right now I'm just trying to get the core ideas across.
            <br />
            The point is, though, this RPG is something I'd love to make at some
            point, but is wildly out of the scope of what I can make in this
            class. I really enjoy this setting and want to make something with
            it though, if nothing else just to put my ideas to paper with what I
            want out of this world. Maybe a TTRPG or world guide for one?<br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <h4>Tamer Tournament</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            This is both the first project I'm likely to start working on and
            maybe the one I'm most excited about. This tabletop game was first
            made for EDL290T, the Tabletop Games & Leadership class. I was
            excited about it then and I'm excited about it now. You can see the
            initial version of the game in the Portfolio tab, but my goal for it
            in this class is to playtest it, refine it, work on the flavor and
            art aspects, and then publish it as a full for-sale print and play,
            if not actually pitch it to a games publisher.<br />
            I'm potentially going to be working with Sadie Zeedrich on this
            project, with her contributing artwork. I'm no artist, and as a
            collaborative piece I think it would be beneficial for both of our
            portfolios.<br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <h4>And...Something Else</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            I've had ideas for other things, of course, but I haven't decided on
            what I would want to do as a third project for this class. Here's a
            nonexhaustive list:<br />
            • Drafting party game where you have to pitch the other players on a
            meal created from odd combinations of ingredients.<br />
            • Expansion upon the Cosmic League Baseball Idea<br />
            I'll add more to this list as I get the ideas.<br />
