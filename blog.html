        <h3>2/4/2023</h3>
        <p>
          Had nothing to do today so was really excited to get a lot done on Tame Tournament and some other assignments. Unfortunately I woke up sick as a dog and had very little energy to do anything.
          I still got some assignments done but overall spent the day lying in bed and churning through an entire box of tissues. Tomorrow hopefully I'm feeling more up to testing.
        </p>
        <h3>2/3/2023</h3>
        <p>
          As I mentioned yesterday, today I had a job interview and plans with friends, so I was booked. The interview went great though!
        </p>
        <h3>2/2/2023</h3>
        <p>
          2 and a half hours later, the prototype is back in business! I'll probably be busy tomorrow with my job interview and other plans, but I'll try to get another playtest in ASAP.<br>
          <img src="img/prototype2.png" class="img-fluid" width="70%"/>
        </p>
        <h3>2/1/2023</h3>
        <p>
        Spent today creating the renders for the great big redesigned cards. Gonna spend tomorrow making a physical prototype for this new version, then going to hop straight into playtesting it as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <h3>1/31/2023</h3>
        <p>
          The great big redesign is completed! Spent a bunch of time yesterday finishing that up. Tomorrow I'm gonna start translating this over to the physical prototype.
        </p>
        <h3>1/30/2023</h3>
        <p>
          The great big redesign begins! Basically all the cards are getting reworked based on the data from the last playtest. Spent about 3 hours total working on it today, and it's just about done. The downsizing is gonna be good for getting the art done, too.
        </p>
        <h3>1/29/2023</h3>
        <p>
        First big playtest was today! A whole lot of things went horribly wrong but that's okay. Here's what we learned.<br>
        • There's too many buffs and the buffs are too high. Players had 70/70 creatures by Round 3. That should not be able to happen.<br>
        • 8 cards per pck and 8 points per round are both too much.<br>
        • Having both temporary and permanent buffs was a bit confusing, and permament buffs contributed towards the crazy endgame numbers.<br>
        • Certain effects were really annoying to try to resolve, with regards to math and decision complexity.<br>
        I've got some ideas for that to change to fix these things, but they're going to require some fairly drastic retooling of the cards, so it'll take a few days I suspect.
        </p>
        <h3>1/28/2023</h3>
        <p>
        Redid the names and art descriptions for a whole bunch of the cards. The current ones, a lot of them were either total placeholders or didn't really match up with their assigned types very well (Young Drachna was a Fire Familiar, but Middle Aged Drachna was an Air Monster!).
        Now, not only do they make a lot more sense and avoid overlap with the same kind of creature on more than one card, there's also a whole lot better pun names. These changes were also made to the physical cards. Planning on doing some playtesting tomorrow.
        </p>
        <h3>1/27/2023</h3>
        <p>
        Spent today working on the "Introduce Yourself" video and things for other classes so didn't have much time to work on personal projects. Was still on the whole a productive day, though.
        </p>
        <h3>1/26/2023</h3>
        <p>
        Went through all the cards from the prototype I have printed out and added the new card numbers to them. This will make it easier to make changes during playtesting and keep track of things, but there were also 192 cards so it took awhile.
        </p>
        <h3>1/25/2023</h3>
        <p>
          Lots of progress today on Tamer Tournament. Sadie and I finalized our plan for how the collaboration is going to work, and I made a great big planning document for all the cards so we can track progress on rebalances and artwork. That took most of the day. <br>
          I've also encountered a potential conceptual problem with State Route 66's in-world world guide. Several important details about the way the world works are totally unknown to its residents. There's not a perfect way to address this while still keeping the in-world component intact,
          though I have had a couple ideas. Specifically, maybe having stuff written in the margins by the theoretical protagonist of the game, who learns these things over the course of their adventure. These being handwritten in pen in the blank spaces of an otherwise printed-appearing document should hopefully make that clear enough.
        </p>
        <h3>1/24/2023</h3>
        <p>
          Spent today researching some possibilities for what to do with State Route 66. On itch.io I was able to find a lot of really cool setting guides for TTRPGs: Many of them were tailored to one specific game system but many were also not. One specific one that I found interesting, though, was "Endsville."<br>
          <a href="https://johnbattle.itch.io/endsville">Link to Endsville on itch.io</a><br>
          Endsville is a setting guide, but written in-universe. This is a really compelling idea for me: Not only does it mean I don't have to tie this to a specific game system (that would break up the flow a lot, imo) it also has lots of its own opportunities for that good Midwestern flair, like one of those travel guides you get at an interstate rest stop. <br>
          There were some other ideas I explored, such as the game "Roll Player" which is essentially competetive character creation: Pretty cool, but I think an execution of that idea for this setting would more likely want to be cooperative, and I'm not quite as enthused about this idea.<br>
          The idea of a diagetic world guide, though, is one I'm really fired up about, and I think that's what I'm going to do with SR66 in this class.<br>
          In blog news, today was <i>actually</i> my birthday. So that's nice.
        </p>
        <h3>1/23/2023</h3>
        <p>
          Wow, first blog post! Here's where I'll be posting progress on my independent projects: I'll try to post something every day. I won't necessarily have something to show for my work every day, but at the very least I'll have chipped away at something.
          <br>
          On a thematic level it might have been better to wait to start this until tomorrow, since that will be the first day of my 20s. "Beginning of a new era" and all that. But ideas wait for no one so this is what you're stuck with.
          <br>
          Today I wanted to try and get at least a rough idea of the projects I was going to spend the next semester working on. All three of these are for a class intended to help with building a portfolio and the skills needed to make a living as a creative. Scoping out these things
          has proven difficult, though. I have a lot of ideas for things to make, but a lot of them are either a bit nebulous at the moment or are of far too grand a scope to be doable within one semester.
          <br>
          <h4>State Route 66</h4><br>
          This is the oldest of the projects I intend to do something with this semester, originating all the way back while I was in high school.<br>
          The biggest thing with this project is its setting, and that's basically the starting point for any project I end up making out of it. This idea was inspired by road-tripping around rural Ohio, and the unique atmosphere of long evening drives down sparsely populated state routes.<br>
          <img src="img/patricks.png" class="img-fluid" width="70%"/><br>
          This setting takes this idea and gives it a fantastical spin. There are two all-powerful beings in the world, a being of Creation and a being of Destruction. Every million years, the being of Destruction annihilates the world, before slumbering for another million years as the being of Creation remakes it anew. However, an excavation project accidentally awakens The Maelstrom early, and while it wipes
          out all of humankind, its work is left incomplete before it runs out of energy, so human civilization is left behind after its destruction.
          <br>
          The being of Creation, unprepared for this premature awakening, does their best to repopulate and remake the world as quickly as possible, shoving the still-present souls of eradicated humans into animals, objects, and whatever
          else it could find. These newly humanoid creatures repopulate this halfway-destroyed world, with lingering memories of language and purpose but a lack of context and history. However, hundreds of years later, the being of Creation senses that the being of Destruction will reawaken again far too soon, and so tasks a ragtag group of heroes with venturing to its resting place at the excavation site and putting a stop
          to this unnatural disruption of the cycle. So would begin a road trip across the country, meeting a wide cast of characters and overcoming various regoinal obstacles along the way.<br>
          The original idea for this project was something like a combat-light JRPG. Essentially, each fight in the game would be a unique character, almost like a bunch of minibosses, and winning each fight would give you access to that character's phone number, where
          in the future you could call them in battle where they'd use a special ability. This would essentially be your spells: Calling different phone numbers would use different amounts of your phone's battery, which would work like MP in other games. Each different assist would have
          a unique effect, and you only have limited memory on your phone to store the numbers you want to use, introducing a deckbuilding-like element of finding different synergies and strategies between all these unique skills. Thematically, this would emphasize the importance of each individual person you meet in your trip, and enshrining each memory as a permanent addition to your arsenal of tools really hammers home that aspect
          of what I love about traveling. In between these combat encounters would be a whole lot of dialogue, puzzle solving, and rural-inspired setpieces and enviornments.
          <br>
          This probably sounds like absolute nonsense: Once I get into working on this project I'm going to write up a better introduction to the setting, but right now I'm just trying to get the core ideas across.
          <br>
          The point is, though, this RPG is something I'd love to make at some point, but is wildly out of the scope of what I can make in this class. I really enjoy this setting and want to make something with it though, if nothing else just to put my ideas to paper with what I want out of this world. Maybe a TTRPG or world guide for one?<br>
          <br>
          <h4>Tamer Tournament</h4><br>
          This is both the first project I'm likely to start working on and maybe the one I'm most excited about. This tabletop game was first made for EDL290T, the Tabletop Games & Leadership class. I was excited about it then and I'm excited about it now. You can see the initial version of the game in the Portfolio tab, but
          my goal for it in this class is to playtest it, refine it, work on the flavor and art aspects, and then publish it as a full for-sale print and play, if not actually pitch it to a games publisher.<br>
          I'm potentially going to be working with Sadie Zeedrich on this project, with her contributing artwork. I'm no artist, and as a collaborative piece I think it would be beneficial for both of our portfolios.<br>
          <br>
          <h4>And...Something Else</h4><br>
          I've had ideas for other things, of course, but I haven't decided on what I would want to do as a third project for this class. Here's a nonexhaustive list:<br>
          • Drafting party game where you have to pitch the other players on a meal created from odd combinations of ingredients.<br>
          • Expansion upon the Cosmic League Baseball Idea<br>
          I'll add more to this list as I get the ideas.<br>
