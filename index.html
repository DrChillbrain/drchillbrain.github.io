            In partnership with 4Wall Entertainment's Special Projects Team and
            Dangerworks, we created two spec commercials for two brands of
            whiskey, shot on ZeroSpace NYC's LED volume.

          <p>
            I was heavily involved with every stage of the project. I served as
            a project manager during the content building phase, with scenes
            being created in Unreal Engine, Blender, and using 2D footage. I was
            the lead on creating the storyboards and plan for the project, and
            was involved in the rescoping process as the clients re-speced the
            project to fit their needs. Our content delivery was high quality
            and on time.

            width="50%"
          />
          <p>
            Primarily, I was the lead on Disguise programming and operation for
            the project. I was the sole media server pre-programmer for both
            ads, and during the shoot days I server as the Media Server Tech,
            operating the screens, troubleshooting issues, and modifying content
            on the fly to create the desired look. This was an incredibly
            valuable experience, to be a Media Server Programmer and Tech on a
            real full two-day film shoot project.

            A giant LED setup of Mario Kart World that was created for the 4Wall
            Entertainment New York Vendor Showcase. The game is piped directly
            to the screens via an Event Master to minimize latency for players.
            The video is also output to Pixera, which reads color and itensity
            data on the screen that then gets sent to TouchDesigner for
            analysis. When TouchDesigner recognizes an event, it sends out an
            OSC signal to StagePrecision, which uses Timecode to trigger the
            relevant action on the stage or screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Custom actions include:<br />
            • During the race countdown, three lights at the top of the screen
            mimic Lakitu's in-game countdown lights.<br />
            • The floor beneath the player in first place flashes. This is
            updated throughout the race.<br />
            • Once all three players have finished the race, the game cuts to a
            full screen view for all players so they can view the results and
            navigate the menus. Once the next race begins, the view is
            automatically adjusted back to the split-screen view.
          </p>
          <p>
            I served an assisting role on this project. I was heavily involved
            in the planning stages for identifying events and planning out
            TouchDesigner logic for recognizing when and how they should be
            triggered, including many events that had to be scrapped due to time
            constraints. I also assisted during the setup stage.

            As part of our Miami University Capstone project in collaboration
            with 4Wall Entertainment, we were tasked with creating an
            all-inclusive Control Dashboard for a virtual production stage, with
            controls for Disguise, Megapixel LED, Blackmagic Cameras, Stage
            Precision, GrandMA3 lighting, and Unreal Engine scenes. The
            dashboard was built in Node-RED with Miami University's XR Stage in
            mind, but is compatible with any XR setup.

            I was tasked with creating Disguise and Unreal Engine functionality
            for the dashboard. My inputting the Director machine's IP and a port
            for an OSC Transport, a user can view machine health, swap between
            tracks, jump to notes, cues, and sections, start, stop, and view the
            status of RenderStream layers, use show control options to play,
            stop, hold, fade up and down, or jump between tracks, and even
            control specified OSC events from within Unreal Engine.

            As part of our Miami University Capstone project in collaboration
            with 4Wall Entertainment, we were tasked with creating a virtual
            production set for a hypothetical Super Bowl broadcast in Unreal
            Engine and Disguise. We chose to create a set based on a blimp,
            flying over Los Angeles. The set features AR front-plate player
            cards and the Vince Lombardi trophy, three movable screens with
            Disguise texture streaming to modify content, and a large back
            window displaying an accurate version of Los Angeles using Cesium.
            With a dedicated "flying" animation the blimp can jump to three
            locations around the city, and using Unreal Engine megalights, the
            enviornment is affected by the lighting from outside of the window.

          />
          <p>
            For this project, I led the charge for Unreal Engine blueprinting
            and technical elements. I created all blueprints in the scene, and
            integrated them with the Control Dashboard (see above) for OSC
            control of all events, lights, and AR elements in the scene. I also
            assisted with ensuring the scene was performant before the broadcast
            by optimizing lighting and 3D elements.

            A parallax 2.5D rendering of the US Capitol building, created for
            the 4Wall ZeroSpace Open House. The visuals were created using photo
            compositing with Adobe Photoshop and GIMP, and the look was achieved
            using Disguise Designer's 2.5D workflow and a StudioBot XL for
            camera tracking. This was a two-person project created
            colaboratively with Christian Smith: Together we implemented all

            editing to the Disguise implementation.

            Using TouchDesigner and a setup using a Microsoft Azure Kinect
            camera, I was able to create this "conductor" toy that allows anyone
            to control music and visuals using only their body. I used
            TouchDesigner's Kinect integration to create a body-tracking setup
            that tracked the positions of the user's arms to allow them to
            control the particles and the music. All of this was displayed on
            Miami University's massive XR stage and sound system.

            with the real time graphics generation, and additional Notch Post-FX
            were used to create a retro-cool look. Using TouchDesigner and a
            specialized LED mapping setup, this setup can be displayed on Miami
            University's XR stage.

            in a 2-week period of brainstorming and development. It features
            both hardware and software to create an immersive and engaging

            The prototype controller we created for the project. It employs an
            Arduino connected to a bluetooth module and some concealed circuitry
            connected to a pressure sensor to allow the user to control video
            games by squeezing their hand. In combination with an electrode
            attached to the upper arm, this allows patients to practice
            regaining fine motor control of their hands after suffering from a
            stroke or other traumatic experience.

            A tabletop drafting game inspired by the Auto-Battler genre, where
            players assemble and train a team of creatures as part of a
            tournament bracket. It was created in two stages over a period of
            four months, in collaboration with two artists, Sadie Zeedrich and
            Elizabth Cool Leitzell.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game features 60 unique cards and gameplay that's easy to learn,
            but has enough depth to encourage replaying and mastering its
            mechanics. The game is currently released in a self-published state
            through The Game Crafter through two seperate editions.

          <p>
            For many years I've been involved with an online game design
            community focused on creating custom game experiences in the ruleset
            of Magic: the Gathering. My aim is to create thematic, innovative,
            and exciting sets of cards that can be played as standalone games.
            Each set has been playtested and refined for more than a year, with
            collaborative input from a full community of fellow designers.
          </p>
          <p>
            My four completed, publicly available sets can be found on my hobby
            website.

            >
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the sets, Viridian's Last Mission, was also part of the
            fanmade Constructed format "Revolution: Custom Standard" from
            September 2021 to September 2023. During that time, I served as a
            curator and organizer for the format, which has more than 50 active
            players each month. The curator team has the responsibility to
            organize monthly "Grand Prix" events and balance the format in
            response to card and deck performance, as well as general player
            feedback. I worked in a team of six other curators during this
            time.<br />

            Video game fansite, created and maintained using JavaScript and PHP.
            Self-hosted through Heroku with Heroku Postgres and AWS databases.
            Built on top of MediaWiki code, but with many customizations for
            cloud computing compatability. It's served thousands of users over
            its lifetime.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: As of March 2025, Beastiepedia is no longer self-hosted.
            However, I still found the experience with Heroku and self-hosting
            very valuable.

            A website that served as an AI tutor for computer science students.
            The site was designed to help push students in the right direction
            by teaching them concepts and methods, rather than spitting out
            finished code. It featured safeguards against attempting to
            circumvent this intention, allowing it to be used by professors as
            an approved AI tool. The site supported four different "mastery
            levels" to allow students to curate their responses. It also allowed
            users to view their history of questions and responses.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site was developed with my friend Mike Lehmkuhl over a span of 6
            weeks. It utilized the OpenAI ChatGPT API, in combination with
            JavaScript, JQuery, Ajax, and PHP. The database was stored via SQL,
            and the site was hosted via OpenStack on Miami University's local
            computer network, for students to access on campus.
